# gnap-caep-risc

A server-side [GNAP](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9635) client. The key is registered by value and proved with mutual TLS, an HTTP message signature, or a detached JWS. Access tokens are key-bound; a bearer token is refused. One Shared Signals poll stream carries CAEP and RISC events.

The private key stays in this process. The same `gnap.json` shape as the Node library loads: the JSON keys are identical.

## Install from a checkout

```bash
mvn -B test
```

The artifact is `com.iyasec:gnap-caep-risc:0.1.0`. Depend on it from this checkout with `mvn install` into the local repository, or add this directory as a module. Maven publishing is not set up yet.

## Three calls

```java
import com.iyasec.gnap.GnapClient;

GnapClient gnap = GnapClient.fromFile("gnap.json");
GnapClient.GrantResult started = gnap.requestGrant();
GnapClient.Finished done = gnap.finishRedirect(query, List.of(started.pending.id));
```

`requestGrant` returns a redirect and a pending grant. `finishRedirect` checks the interaction hash against grants this process started, then continues the grant with the key proof. Pass the pending ids this browser was given.

`GnapClient.resolve` and `Config.readFile` load the same document without starting a grant.

## Signals

`signals` omitted or `true` keeps CAEP and RISC on. The resolved configuration omits the key, fills `ssf` from `ssf.transmitter` or `transmitterIssuer`, and asks for `ssf.read` and `ssf.manage` when `access` does not say otherwise.

`signals: false` does not start the Shared Signals receiver, does not require transmitter metadata, and drops `ssf.read` and `ssf.manage` from the GNAP access. The resolved configuration includes `signals: false`. If those two rights were the only ones, configuration fails and asks for another right the authorization server grants. Any other value fails with `signals must be true or false`.

`ssf.pollIntervalMs` is the poll interval in milliseconds.

## Demo

```bash
mvn -q exec:java
```

`PORT` defaults to 3000 and is the bind port. Loopback finish and display URLs follow `PORT`. Any other host is left as written. `PUBLIC_URL` or `--public-url` replaces the origin and keeps the path. `GET /healthz` returns `ok`. The home page has a sign-in control; `/login` starts a grant, `/callback` finishes it, and `POST /logout` signs out.

The shipped `demo/gnap.json` leaves `signals` on by omitting the key. Key material is `file:` or `env:` and is not in the tree. Generate a key, then register the application with the Python registrar in this repo:

```bash
ADMIN_API_CLIENT_SECRET=… python3 scripts/configure_iya_sts.py --config demo/gnap.json
```

`--dry-run` prints the admin API calls and sends nothing. When the `gnap-demo` container is running, its `PORT` wins over the shell `PORT`.
